# A-Power-BI-Analysis-for-a-Banking-Company
The project aims to prevent customer churning in a banking company using Power BI. Task 1 involves adding the "FEBS-" prefix to Customer Id and converting 1 to "Yes" and 0 to "No" in the 'Exited' and 'Complaint' columns. Task 2 focuses on creating an interactive Power BI report called "BI BRILLIANCE BY FEBS" to provide critical insights for business decisions. The report will analyze customer data and highlight key information. Task 3 requires writing a DAX query to filter the dataset by Card Type as "Platinum" and creating a measure to calculate cumulative salaries. The project's goal is to leverage data analysis and visualization to understand customer behavior, optimize business strategies, and retain customers.
